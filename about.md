I am a second-year Master's student in Biomedical Informatics at Stanford University. I received my Bachelor's in Biophysical Chemistry from Dartmouth College. 

I have a strong interest in variational inference, generative modeling, and deep learning. I really like variational methods and am particularly interested in using information-theoretic approaches to improve upon existing deep generative models, and in its application to semi-supervised learning.

If you are interested in knowing more about what I've worked on, please see my [CV](/rui-shu-curriculum.pdf).
