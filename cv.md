<!-- hi -->
<!-- ## Research Interests -->
<!-- I have a strong interest in the intersection of deep learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised learning, and computer vision. My current interest lies in the use of deep generative models for vision-based reinforcement learning tasks and sparse-reward environments. In the past, I have also done research related to probabilistic graphical models and Gaussian processes. -->
